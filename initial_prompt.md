# Initial prompt

I want to create a project that will be running in python that will:

- On start open tabs on controlled chrome (playwright maybe)
- These tabs will be opening pages like: grok, open gpt, gemini, claude, perplexity. whatsapp web
- All it will do is to wait for user login in those platforms
- the intention is too, every time this we receive a message in a whatsapp, we go to the proper tab, repass the message (adding, maximum 350 characteres - to make message short).
- After message is loaded it will be copying the response and repassing it to the whatsapp channel.
- We will have a mapping of the group chat  and the IA system, so that when I send message to certain channel, it will execute the question in the correct AI.
- I can help with the media queries for the interacitons on AI later if you cant solve that to me.
- This service can be in python, using poetry or a moderm better tool


This is a personal project, just for fun.
