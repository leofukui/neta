# Hey Neta üëãüè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è: Your AI Agents, Now on WhatsApp!

**(Your Pocket AI Bridge, Built with Python & Shenanigans)**

Ever wish you could just ping your favorite AI assistant directly from WhatsApp, perhaps even send it a picture you just snapped with your fancy smart glasses? Neta is here to (hackily) make that happen!

This Python application connects WhatsApp Web to various AI platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, Grok) using UI automation. It automatically grabs messages and images from your designated WhatsApp chats, sends them to the corresponding AI, and brings back the response.

## The Origin Story ‚ú®üîÆ

This project was **vibe coded** in less than 24 hours, fueled by mild annoyance. Why? Because those otherwise cool Ray-Ban Meta glasses often replied "I can't do that on your glasses." Neta was created to bridge that gap, taking your WhatsApp messages (text or images!) and getting answers from the major AI platforms.

The default settings are optimized for responses that are easily read back by smart glasses and concise enough for WhatsApp ‚Äì but hey, it's your hack, feel free to tweak it!

**üëâ Meet the Crew (Your AI Agents):**

| Platform    | Neta Agent    | Provider    |
| :---------- | :------------ | :---------- |
| ChatGPT     | Capivara      | OpenAI      |
| Grok        | Birdo         | xAI         |
| Gemini      | Gemininas     | Google      |
| Claude      | Claudio       | Anthropic   |
| Perplexity  | Perplexo      | Perplexity AI|

## üö® Important Warnings & Disclaimers üö®

* **UI Automation, Not APIs:** This project interacts with the *web interfaces* of WhatsApp and the AI platforms. It's **hacky** and relies on screen scraping and UI element interaction. This means it can break if/when those websites change their layout. It does *not* use official APIs.
* **Use Your Own Accounts:** Neta bridges *your* WhatsApp account to *your* AI service accounts. You need to be logged into these services in the browser tabs that Neta controls.
* **Potential Costs:** Using Neta will utilize your existing subscriptions/credits on the connected AI platforms just as if you were using their websites directly. Any associated costs are your responsibility.
* **AI Built This (Mostly):** This project is proudly ~95% AI-generated and ~5% human-debugged. ü§ñüë®‚Äçüíª Expect quirks!

## Features

* üîó **Connect WhatsApp Web** with multiple AI platforms simultaneously.
* üí¨ **Process Text Messages:** Send prompts directly from WhatsApp.
* üñºÔ∏è **Process Image Messages:** Send images from WhatsApp for AI analysis.
* üëì **Optimized for Readability:** Default settings aim for concise replies suitable for smart glasses or quick reading.

## In Progress ‚è∞

* üñºÔ∏è Returning images *from* AI chats back to WhatsApp.
* ‚ö° Performance enhancements (it's Python UI automation, so 'performance' is relative!).

## Getting Started: Let the Hacking Begin!

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) (for managing dependencies effectively)
* Google Chrome browser (Neta needs to control it!)
* **Operating System:** Currently, Neta has only been tested on **macOS**. It *might* work on Linux or Windows with adjustments (especially regarding Chrome profile paths and potentially UI selectors), but this is not guaranteed or supported.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/leofukui/neta.git](https://github.com/leofukui/neta.git)
    cd neta
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

3.  **Set Up Environment Configuration:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Now, **edit the `.env` file**. You *must* set your Chrome profile path (`CHROME_PROFILE_PATH`). You can also adjust timing settings here if interactions seem too fast or slow.

4.  **Map Your Chats (AI Configuration):**
    * Look inside the `config/` directory. You'll find JSON files (e.g., `default.json`).
    * These files map a **WhatsApp Chat Name** (case-sensitive!) to an AI platform and its specific UI selectors (used by Neta to find input boxes and response elements).
    * **Edit these files** to match the *exact names* of the WhatsApp chats you want Neta to monitor for each AI.
    * *Example snippet from a config file:*
        ```json
        {
          "Capivara": { // This MUST match your WhatsApp chat name for ChatGPT
            "url": "[https://chat.openai.com/](https://chat.openai.com/)",
            "tab_name": "ChatGPT", // How Neta names the browser tab
            "input_selector": "#prompt-textarea", // CSS selector for the input field
            "response_selector": ".markdown", // CSS selector for the response area
            "agent_enabled": true
          },
          // ... other AI configs
        }
        ```

### WhatsApp & AI Setup

1.  **Name Your Chats:** Ensure the WhatsApp chats you intend to use have the *exact same names* as the keys in your JSON configuration file (e.g., "Capivara", "Birdo", "Gemininas"). Tip: Create WhatsApp groups with these exact names.
2.  **Launch Neta:** Run the application (see Usage section below).
3.  **Scan QR Codes:**
    * First, Neta will open WhatsApp Web. Scan the QR code with your phone to log in.
    * Then, Neta will open tabs for *each enabled AI platform* specified in your config. You will likely need to **manually log in** to each of these AI services in their respective browser tabs the first time (and whenever your sessions expire). Neta requires active sessions to function!

### Sending Messages from Smart Glasses (e.g., Ray-Ban Meta)

1.  Using your smart glasses, initiate sending a message or picture via WhatsApp to the specific chat Neta is monitoring for your chosen AI agent.
    * Example voice command: *"Hey Neta, send a picture on WhatsApp to Capivara."* (Replace "Capivara" with the actual chat name/agent name you've configured).
2.  Receive the AI's response (e.g., image description) via your glasses' audio.

## Usage

```bash
# Run Neta with the default configuration (config/default.json)
poetry run neta

# Run with a specific configuration file
poetry run neta --config path/to/your/custom_config.json

# Increase logging verbosity and save to a file
poetry run neta --log-level DEBUG --log-file logs/neta_debug.log
